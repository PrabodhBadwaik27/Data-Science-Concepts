# Linear Regression

## Assumptions of Linear Regression

1. Linearity  
2. Homoscedasticity  
3. Multivariate Normality  
4. Independence of Errors  
5. Lack of Multicollinearity  

### Dummy Variables
**Dummy Variables** are the columns which are newly created for every value present in the *categorical variables* in dataset.

***Dummy Variable Trap***  
Always omit one dummy variable for every categorical variable.
