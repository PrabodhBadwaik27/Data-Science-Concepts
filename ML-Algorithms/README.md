# Machine Learning Algorithms

## Types of Machine Learning & Algorithms
1. ***Supervised Learning***
This algorithm consist of a target / outcome variable (or dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent variables). Using these set of variables, we generate a function that map inputs to desired outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.
    - Regression
        - Linear Regression
        - Decision Tree
    - Classification
        - Logistic Regression    
        - Naive Bayes
        - Random Forest
        - k-Nearest Neighbours
    - Gradient Boosting
        - GBM
        - XGBoost
        - LightGBM
        - CatBoost

2. ***Unsupervised Learning***
In this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict / estimate. It is used for clustering population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention.
    - Clustering
        - Apriori Algorithm
        - K-means
        - K-medoids
    - Dimensionality Reduction
        - Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
        - Feature Selection
        - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) 

3. ***Reinforcement Learning***
In this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict / estimate. It is used for clustering population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention.
    - Markov Decision Process
