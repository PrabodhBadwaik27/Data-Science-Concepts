# Machine Learning Algorithms

## Types of Machine Learning & Algorithms
1. ***Supervised Learning***
This algorithm consist of a target / outcome variable (or dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent variables). Using these set of variables, we generate a function that map inputs to desired outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.

        - Linear Regression
        - Decision Tree
        - [Logistic Regression](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/what-is-logistic-regression/)
    - Classification
        - Naive Bayes
        - Random Forest
        - k-Nearest Neighbours
    - Gradient Boosting
        - GBM
        - XGBoost
        - LightGBM
        - CatBoost

2. ***Unsupervised Learning***
In this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict / estimate. It is used for clustering population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention.
    - Clustering
        - Apriori Algorithm
        - K-means
        - K-medoids
    - Dimensionality Reduction
        - Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
        - Feature Selection
        - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) 

3. ***Reinforcement Learning***
In this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict / estimate. It is used for clustering population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention.
    - Markov Decision Process

## Regression
Regression models (both linear and non-linear) are used for predicting a real value.  
If the independent variable is *time*, then dependent varible will denote *future* values.  
Otherwise, the model will predict *present but unknown values*.

### Types of Regression
1. Simple Regression
No. of Dependent Variables: 1
No. of Independent Variables: 1
Equation: y = c + mx

2. Multiple Regression
No. of Dependent Variables: 1
No. of Independent Variables: N
Equation: y = c + m1\*x1 + m2\*x2 + ... + mN\*xN

3. Polynomial Regression
No. of Dependent Variables: 1
No. of Independent Variables: N
Equation: y = c + m1\*x + m2\*x\*\*2 + .. + mN\*x\*\*N
