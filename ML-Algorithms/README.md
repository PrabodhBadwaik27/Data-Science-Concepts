# Machine Learning Algorithms

## Types of Machine Learning & Algorithms
1. ***Supervised Learning***
This algorithm consist of a target / outcome variable (or dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent variables). Using these set of variables, we generate a function that map inputs to desired outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data.
    - Regression
        - Linear Regression
        - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - k-Nearest Neighbours

2. ***Unsupervised Learning***
In this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict / estimate. It is used for clustering population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention.
    - Apriori Algorithm
    - K-means 
    
3. ***Reinforcement Learning***
In this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict / estimate. It is used for clustering population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention.
    - Markov Decision Process
